# Armybot Web GUI 

A simple web-based control interface for operating the 4 Wheel Drive Differential Drive Robotin Gazebo simulation using **ROS 2**, **rosbridge**, and **roslibjs**.

This interface allows you to:
- Connect to the robot via WebSocket
- Send velocity (`/cmd_vel`) commands from your browser
- Switch between basic navigation commands (Forward, Backward, Left, Right, Stop)
